## The most important commands

- clone a repository with: `git clone http://www.thelinkyouwanttoclone.com.git`
- update a repository with: `git pull`
- commmit to a repository with: `git commit -am "insert here your comment"`
- after you've added one or multiple files to a folder you must type `git add .` to show git the fact that you want to add them remotely 
- after a _commit_ or an _add_ you need to push your files into the repository via this command: `git push`
